# 🚀 KICKAI YAML Configuration Migration Guide

This guide explains the migration from the Python-based CrewAI configuration to the new YAML-based approach.

## 📋 Overview

The new YAML-based configuration provides:
- **Cleaner separation** of concerns (configuration vs. logic)
- **Easier maintenance** and updates
- **Better readability** for non-developers
- **Version control friendly** YAML format
- **Template-based** approach for consistency

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

### Before (Python-based):
```python
# Complex Python configuration scattered across multiple files
agent = Agent(
    role="Complex role definition...",
    goal="Complex goal definition...",
    backstory="Complex backstory...",
    tools=[tool1, tool2, tool3],
    llm=llm_config,
    verbose=True
)
```

### After (YAML-based):
```yaml
# Clean YAML configuration
player_coordinator:
  role: >
    KICKAI Player Coordination Agent
  goal: >
    Manage player registrations, status updates, and coordinate player-related
    activities across the system
  backstory: >
    You are responsible for all player-related operations in the KICKAI system.
    You handle player registrations, status checks, approvals, and coordinate
    with other agents to ensure smooth player management workflows.
```

## 📁 New File Structure

```
config/
├── agents.yaml          # All agent definitions
├── tasks.yaml           # All task definitions
crew.py                  # Crew instantiation logic
main.py                  # Main entry point
requirements-yaml.txt    # YAML dependencies
```

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. **Install YAML dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-yaml.txt
   ```

2. **Verify CrewAI version:**
   ```bash
   pip show crewai
   # Should be >= 0.70.0
   ```

3. **Test the new configuration:**
   ```bash
   python crew.py
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `config/agents.yaml`
Defines all agents with their roles, goals, and backstories:

```yaml
player_coordinator:
  role: >
    KICKAI Player Coordination Agent
  goal: >
    Manage player registrations, status updates, and coordinate player-related
    activities across the system
  backstory: >
    You are responsible for all player-related operations in the KICKAI system.
    You handle player registrations, status checks, approvals, and coordinate
    with other agents to ensure smooth player management workflows.
```

### `config/tasks.yaml`
Defines all tasks with descriptions and agent assignments:

```yaml
register_player:
  description: >
    Guide new players through the registration process, collect required information,
    and create player profiles in the system
  expected_output: >
    Complete player registration with all required information and confirmation
  agent: onboarding_agent
```

### `crew.py`
Minimal Python code that loads YAML configuration:

```python
class KICKAICrew:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents_config = self._load_yaml_config("agents.yaml")
        self.tasks_config = self._load_yaml_config("tasks.yaml")
        self.agents = self._create_agents()
        self.tasks = self._create_tasks()
        self.crew = self._create_crew()
```

## 🔄 Migration Process

### Step 1: Backup Current Configuration
```bash
cp -r src/config src/config_backup
```

### Step 2: Install New Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements-yaml.txt
```

### Step 3: Test New Configuration
```bash
python crew.py
```

### Step 4: Update Main Entry Point
**Note: The old YAML-based crew system has been removed. The system now uses the modern TeamManagementSystem approach.**

### Step 5: Verify Functionality
1. Start the bot: `python run_bot_local.py`
2. Test commands in Telegram
3. Verify all functionality works as expected

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Individual Components:
```bash
# Test TeamManagementSystem
python -c "from src.agents.crew_agents import TeamManagementSystem; system = TeamManagementSystem('KTI'); print('✅ TeamManagementSystem loaded successfully')"

# Test agent creation
python -c "from src.agents.crew_agents import TeamManagementSystem; system = TeamManagementSystem('KTI'); print(f'✅ Created {len(system.agents)} agents')"

# Test tool discovery
python -c "from src.agents.tool_registry import get_tool_registry; registry = get_tool_registry(); registry.auto_discover_tools(); print(f'✅ Found {len(registry.get_tool_names())} tools')"
```

### Test Full System:
```bash
# Start the bot
python run_bot_local.py

# Test in Telegram:
# - /help command
# - Natural language queries
# - Player registration
# - Team management
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **YAML Parsing Errors:**
   ```bash
   # Check YAML syntax
   python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/agents.yaml'))"
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install PyYAML>=6.0
   ```

3. **CrewAI Version Issues:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade crewai>=0.70.0
   ```

4. **Tool Registration Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check tool registry
   python -c "from src.agents.tool_registry import get_tool_registry; registry = get_tool_registry(); print(registry.list_all_tools())"
   ```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Aspect | Python-based | YAML-based |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Configuration Size | ~500 lines | ~200 lines |
| Maintenance | Complex | Simple |
| Readability | Medium | High |
| Version Control | Good | Excellent |
| Debugging | Complex | Simple |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance:** Track system performance with new configuration
2. **Gather Feedback:** Collect user feedback on system behavior
3. **Optimize:** Fine-tune YAML configurations based on usage patterns
4. **Document:** Update documentation with new configuration approach

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the YAML syntax in configuration files
3. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Test with minimal configuration first

## 🎉 Migration Complete!

Once you've completed the migration:

- ✅ Modern TeamManagementSystem is active
- ✅ All agents are defined in YAML configuration
- ✅ System is using the new agentic architecture
- ✅ Main entry point is updated to use run_bot_local.py
- ✅ All functionality is verified

The KICKAI system is now using the modern YAML-based CrewAI configuration approach! 🚀
