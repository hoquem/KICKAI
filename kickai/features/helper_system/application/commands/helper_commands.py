Helper System Commands

This module registers all helper system related commands with the command registry.
The helper system is primarily proactive but provides some command-driven interactions.

Note: Helper system commands have been removed as they are not part of the core command set.
The helper system operates proactively through the agent system rather than command-driven interactions.
