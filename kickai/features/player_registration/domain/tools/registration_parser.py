Registration Parser Tools

This module provides tools for parsing registration-related commands.
Note: The /register command has been removed in favor of the /addplayer + invite link workflow.
"""

# This file is kept for potential future use but the registration parser tool has been removed
# as the /register command is no longer part of the system workflow.

# The current workflow is:
# 1. Leadership uses /addplayer to create player records
# 2. Players join via invite links
# 3. Players link their phone numbers to existing records
# 4. Players use /update to modify their details
