## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Background Task Architecture

```python
# Background task manager now includes:
class BackgroundTaskManager:
    async def start_onboarding_reminder_service(self, team_id: str):
        # Checks for players needing reminders every 6 hours
        # Sends automated reminders
        # Logs reminder activity
        
    async def start_reminder_cleanup_service(self, team_id: str):
        # Cleans up reminder data for completed players
        # Runs every 24 hours
        # Resets reminder counters
```

### Reminder Service Integration

```python
# Reminder service is integrated into background tasks:
from src.services.reminder_service import get_reminder_service

# Get reminder service for team
reminder_service = get_reminder_service(team_id)

# Check and send reminders
reminders_sent = await reminder_service.check_and_send_reminders()

# Send manual reminders
success, message = await reminder_service.send_manual_reminder(player_id, admin_id)
```

### Task Scheduling

| Service | Interval | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| FA Registration Checker | 24 hours | Check FA registration status |
