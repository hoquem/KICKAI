**Impact:** Medium - Expense categorization is used in financial management

#### 1.9 RegistryType Enum
**Locations:**
- `kickai/core/registry/base.py:17` (Registry base)
- `kickai/core/registry_manager.py:20` (Registry manager)

**Values:** Both have identical values (likely registry types)

**Impact:** High - Registry system is core infrastructure

#### 1.10 CheckStatus Enum
**Locations:**
- `kickai/core/enums.py:205` (Centralized)
- `kickai/core/startup_validation/reporting.py:14` (Startup validation)

**Values:** Both have identical values: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `WARN`

**Impact:** Medium - Check status is used in validation systems

#### 1.11 CheckCategory Enum
**Locations:**
- `kickai/core/enums.py:213` (Centralized)
- `kickai/core/startup_validation/reporting.py:23` (Startup validation)

**Values:** Both have identical values: `CONNECTIVITY`, `FUNCTIONALITY`, `PERFORMANCE`, `SECURITY`

**Impact:** Medium - Check categories are used in validation systems

#### 1.12 TestType Enum
**Locations:**
- `tests/frameworks/e2e_framework.py:51` (E2E framework)
- `tests/frameworks/multi_client_e2e_framework.py:24` (Multi-client framework)

**Values:** Both likely have similar test type values

**Impact:** Low - Test frameworks are separate utilities

### 2. Duplicate Class Implementations (2 total)

#### 2.1 AgentToolsManager Class
**Locations:**
- `kickai/agents/configurable_agent.py:42` (Configurable agent)
- `kickai/agents/crew_agents.py:56` (Crew agents)

**Differences:**
- **Configurable Agent Version:** Simple tool retrieval from registry
- **Crew Agents Version:** More complex with entity-specific validation and logging

**Impact:** High - Two different tool management approaches could cause confusion

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Consolidate TeamStatus Enum**
   - Remove duplicate from `team_administration/domain/entities/team.py`
   - Import from `kickai/core/enums.py`

2. **Consolidate PlayerPosition Enum**
   - Merge the two different position sets into a single enum in `kickai/core/enums.py`
   - Update both locations to use the centralized enum
   - Ensure all position values are compatible

3. **Consolidate AgentToolsManager**
   - Merge the two implementations into a single class
   - Keep the more advanced features from the crew_agents version
   - Update configurable_agent to use the unified implementation

### Medium Priority Actions

4. **Consolidate Payment Enums**
   - Remove duplicates from payment_management domain entities
   - Import from `kickai/core/enums.py`

5. **Consolidate Health Monitoring Enums**
   - Remove duplicates from health_monitoring domain entities
   - Import from `kickai/core/enums.py`

6. **Consolidate RegistryType Enum**
   - Keep in `kickai/core/registry/base.py` as the authoritative source
   - Import in `kickai/core/registry_manager.py`

### Low Priority Actions

7. **Consolidate Validation Enums**
   - Remove duplicates from startup_validation
   - Import from `kickai/core/enums.py`

8. **Consolidate TestType Enum**
   - Consider creating a shared test utilities module
   - Or keep separate as they serve different test frameworks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Consolidations
1. Create migration script to update all imports
2. Consolidate TeamStatus, PlayerPosition, and AgentToolsManager
3. Update all references to use centralized enums
4. Run comprehensive tests

### Phase 2: Domain Consolidations
1. Consolidate payment-related enums
2. Consolidate health monitoring enums
3. Update domain entities to use centralized enums
4. Validate business logic still works

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Consolidations
1. Consolidate registry and validation enums
2. Update infrastructure components
3. Final validation and testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **PlayerPosition Enum:** Different position sets could break validation
- **AgentToolsManager:** Different implementations could cause tool access issues
- **TeamStatus:** Inconsistent team state management

### Medium Risk
- **Payment Enums:** Financial data consistency
- **Health Monitoring:** System monitoring reliability
- **Registry System:** Core infrastructure stability

### Low Risk
- **Test Enums:** Testing framework isolation
- **Validation Enums:** Startup validation only

## Conclusion

The codebase has significant duplication that should be addressed systematically. The most critical issues are around player positions, agent tool management, and team status. Following the recommended consolidation plan will improve maintainability and reduce the risk of inconsistencies.
