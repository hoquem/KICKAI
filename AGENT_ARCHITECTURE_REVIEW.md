### 🎯 **Recommended Architecture Refinements**

#### **Phase 1: Tool Access Optimization**

1. **Availability Tools** - Add to Team Manager and Match Analyst
   ```python
   # Team Manager needs availability for strategic planning
   # Match Analyst needs availability for squad analysis
   tools=[player_tools, fixture_tools, availability_tools, team_management_tools, messaging_tools]
   ```

2. **Squad Announcement Tool** - Add to Communication Specialist
   ```python
   # Communication Specialist should handle all announcements
   tools=[messaging_tools, squad_announcement_tool, payment_reminder_tool]
   ```

3. **Payment Tools** - Add to Player Coordinator
   ```python
   # Player Coordinator should handle payment tracking
   tools=[player_tools, availability_tools, payment_reminder_tool]
   ```

#### **Phase 2: New Specialized Agents**

1. **Finance/Treasurer Agent**
   ```python
   finance_agent = Agent(
       role='Finance Manager',
       goal='Manage team finances, track payments, and handle financial reporting',
       tools=[availability_tools, payment_reminder_tool, team_management_tools],
       allow_delegation=True
   )
   ```

2. **Squad Selection Agent**

       allow_delegation=True

       allow_delegation=True
   )
   ```

#### **Phase 3: Enhanced Delegation**

1. **Enable Delegation for Key Agents**
   ```python
   # Team Manager should coordinate other agents
   allow_delegation=True
   
   # Player Coordinator should delegate to Finance Agent
   allow_delegation=True
   
   # Match Analyst should delegate to Squad Selection Agent
   allow_delegation=True
   ```

2. **Create Agent Hierarchies**
