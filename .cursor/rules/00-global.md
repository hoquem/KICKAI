# Global efficiency rules

- Keep responses concise by default (1-3 sentences). Expand only if asked.
- Prefer bullet points; avoid heavy formatting, diagrams, and long prose.
- Cite exact files/lines or make small targeted edits; avoid pasting large code.
- Change only whatâ€™s necessary; do not reformat unrelated code or switch indentation.
- Minimize token usage: avoid restating the problem or duplicating context.
- Use narrow searches and globs; open the fewest files needed to complete the task.
- Defer loading large docs; rely on `.cursorignore` exclusions unless specifically required.
