# KICKAI Project Overview

**Guiding Principles (apply to all new code and refactors):**
- Keep code complexity low: prefer simple, readable, maintainable code
- All features must be modularized (feature-first, not monolithic)
- Use dependency injection and the DI container for all dependencies
- Strictly enforce clean architecture dependency rules
- All code must be clean, testable, and maintainable
