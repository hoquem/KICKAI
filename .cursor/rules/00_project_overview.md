# KICKAI Project Overview

**Guiding Principles (apply to all new code and refactors):**
- Keep code complexity low: prefer simple, readable, maintainable code
- All features must be modularized (feature-first, not monolithic)
- Use dependency injection and the DI container for all dependencies
- Strictly enforce clean architecture dependency rules
- All code must be clean, testable, and maintainable

## üéØ **Project Status: PRODUCTION READY WITH PARTIAL FEATURES**

KICKAI is a sophisticated Telegram bot system for football team management, built with an 8-agent AI architecture using CrewAI. The system is **production-ready** for core functionality with some features in development.

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**

- **Bot System**: ‚úÖ Fully operational with unified message handler
- **Agent Architecture**: ‚úÖ 8-agent system working correctly
- **Command Processing**: ‚úÖ Core commands functional (help, status, list, myinfo, etc.)
- **Database Integration**: ‚úÖ Firebase Firestore integration working
- **Player Management**: ‚úÖ Complete player registration and management
- **Match Management**: ‚úÖ Match creation, scheduling, and attendance tracking
- **Attendance Management**: ‚úÖ Match attendance tracking and reporting
- **Payment Management**: ‚ùå Removed (not a priority for Sunday league)
- **Communication**: ‚úÖ Team announcements and messaging
- **Tool Classes**: ‚úÖ Fixed all class-level attribute issues
- **Agent Routing**: ‚úÖ Resolved routing and execution issues

## üöß **Features in Development**

- **Training Management**: ‚ùå Removed (not a priority for Sunday league)
- **E2E Testing**: üöß Framework exists but requires telethon dependency
- **Advanced Analytics**: üöß Basic implementation, needs enhancement

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

- **13-Agent CrewAI System**: Organized in logical layers - Primary Interface (MESSAGE_PROCESSOR), Operational (PLAYER_COORDINATOR, TEAM_MANAGER, SQUAD_SELECTOR, AVAILABILITY_MANAGER, TRAINING_COORDINATOR), Specialized (HELP_ASSISTANT, ONBOARDING_AGENT, COMMUNICATION_MANAGER, PERFORMANCE_ANALYST), Infrastructure (FINANCE_MANAGER, LEARNING_AGENT, COMMAND_FALLBACK_AGENT)
- **Service Discovery System**: Dynamic service registration, health monitoring, and circuit breaker patterns
- **Intelligent System**: Intent classification, task decomposition, capability-based routing, orchestrated execution
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
- **Multi-Chat Support**: Main team chat and leadership chat functionality
- **Feature-Based Modular Design**: Each feature is self-contained with application, domain, and infrastructure layers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 3-layer test pyramid with service discovery testing infrastructure

## üîß **Recent Major Fixes**

1. **Tool Class Architecture**: Fixed all tool classes to have proper class-level attributes
2. **Agent Routing System**: Resolved "No available agents for routing" errors
3. **Architectural Clarification**: Formalized central orchestrator and agent roles
4. **Pydantic Validation**: Fixed type inference and validation issues
5. **Command Registry**: Implemented unified command system with proper permission handling
