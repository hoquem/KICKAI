# KICKAI Project Overview

**Guiding Principles (apply to all new code and refactors):**
- Keep code complexity low: prefer simple, readable, maintainable code
- All features must be modularized (feature-first, not monolithic)
- Use dependency injection and the DI container for all dependencies
- Strictly enforce clean architecture dependency rules
- All code must be clean, testable, and maintainable

## 🎯 **Project Status: PRODUCTION READY WITH PARTIAL FEATURES**

KICKAI is a sophisticated Telegram bot system for football team management, built with an 8-agent AI architecture using CrewAI. The system is **production-ready** for core functionality with some features in development.

## ✅ **Current Status**

- **Bot System**: ✅ Fully operational with unified message handler
- **Agent Architecture**: ✅ 8-agent system working correctly
- **Command Processing**: ✅ Core commands functional (help, status, list, myinfo, etc.)
- **Database Integration**: ✅ Firebase Firestore integration working
- **Player Management**: ✅ Complete player registration and management
- **Match Management**: ✅ Match creation, scheduling, and attendance tracking
- **Attendance Management**: ✅ Match attendance tracking and reporting
- **Payment Management**: ✅ Payment creation and tracking
- **Communication**: ✅ Team announcements and messaging
- **Tool Classes**: ✅ Fixed all class-level attribute issues
- **Agent Routing**: ✅ Resolved routing and execution issues

## 🚧 **Features in Development**

- **Training Management**: 🚧 Partially implemented (tools and entities exist, commands defined but not integrated)
- **E2E Testing**: 🚧 Framework exists but requires telethon dependency
- **Advanced Analytics**: 🚧 Basic implementation, needs enhancement

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

- **8-Agent CrewAI System**: MessageProcessor, TeamManager, PlayerCoordinator, FinanceManager, PerformanceAnalyst, LearningAgent, OnboardingAgent, CommandFallbackAgent
- **Intelligent System**: Intent classification, task decomposition, capability-based routing, orchestrated execution
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
- **Multi-Chat Support**: Main team chat and leadership chat functionality
- **Feature-Based Modular Design**: Each feature is self-contained with application, domain, and infrastructure layers

## 🔧 **Recent Major Fixes**

1. **Tool Class Architecture**: Fixed all tool classes to have proper class-level attributes
2. **Agent Routing System**: Resolved "No available agents for routing" errors
3. **Architectural Clarification**: Formalized central orchestrator and agent roles
4. **Pydantic Validation**: Fixed type inference and validation issues
5. **Command Registry**: Implemented unified command system with proper permission handling
