### üöß **Partially Implemented Features**

#### Training Management
**Status**: ‚ùå **REMOVED** - Not a priority for Sunday league team management

**Reason**: Sunday league teams typically focus on match management rather than formal training sessions.

#### E2E Testing
**Status**: Framework exists but requires telethon dependency

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Training Management Integration (Removed)**

Training management has been removed from the system as it's not a priority for Sunday league team management.

**Focus Areas**: Match management, player registration, and attendance tracking are the core priorities.

### 2. **Complete E2E Testing Setup**

#### Step 1: Install Telethon Dependency
```bash
pip install telethon
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Test Environment
**File**: `.env.test`

Ensure test environment variables are properly configured.

#### Step 3: Create Comprehensive Test Suites
- Player registration E2E tests
- Match management E2E tests
- Attendance management E2E tests
- Match management E2E tests
- Match management E2E tests
