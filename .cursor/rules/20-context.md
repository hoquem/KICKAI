# Context and search rules

- Default focus: `kickai/**` Python sources. Avoid loading `tests/**` unless fixing tests.
- Prefer exact file paths and tight directory scopes over broad repository scans.
- When citing code, include the smallest useful snippet; avoid large blocks.
- Do not load large Markdown or data files unless explicitly needed for the task.
- If a file exceeds ~1K lines, search within it instead of reading the entire file.
