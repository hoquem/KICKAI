10. **CheckStatus** - Different values
    - `kickai/core/enums.py:206` (PASS, FAIL, WARN)
    - `kickai/core/startup_validation/reporting.py:15` (PASSED, FAILED, WARNING, SKIPPED)

11. **CheckCategory** - Different values
    - `kickai/core/enums.py:214` (CONNECTIVITY, FUNCTIONALITY, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY)
    - `kickai/core/startup_validation/reporting.py:24` (LLM, AGENT, TOOL, TASK, EXTERNAL_SERVICE, CONFIGURATION, DATABASE, TELEGRAM)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è LOW RISK (1 duplicate) - Consider addressing

12. **Environment** - Identical values
    - `kickai/core/enums.py:197` (DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, STAGING, PRODUCTION)
    - `kickai/core/settings.py:19` (DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, TESTING)

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. PlayerPosition Enum Mismatch
**Problem:** Two different position sets could cause validation errors
- Player registration uses: `GOALKEEPER`, `DEFENDER`, `MIDFIELDER`, `FORWARD`, `UTILITY`
- Football ID generator uses: `GOALKEEPER`, `DEFENDER`, `MIDFIELDER`, `FORWARD`, `WINGER`, `STRIKER`

**Impact:** Players could be assigned positions that don't exist in the ID generator, or vice versa.

### 2. Payment System Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Payment types and statuses have different values in different parts of the system
- Core enums define payment types for fees, fines, refunds
- Payment management domain defines types for manual, link, request payments
- Status values are inconsistent between core and domain

**Impact:** Payment processing could fail or behave unexpectedly.

### 3. Registry System Confusion
**Problem:** Registry types are defined differently in base and manager
- Base defines: `TOOL`, `COMMAND`, `SERVICE`
- Manager defines: `COMMAND`, `AGENT`, `TOOL`, `TASK`

**Impact:** Registry operations could fail or behave inconsistently.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)

1. **Fix PlayerPosition Enum**
   ```bash
   # Create unified PlayerPosition enum in kickai/core/enums.py
   # Include all positions: GOALKEEPER, DEFENDER, MIDFIELDER, FORWARD, UTILITY, WINGER, STRIKER
   # Update both locations to use centralized enum
   ```

2. **Fix TeamStatus Enum**
   ```bash
   # Remove duplicate from team_administration/domain/entities/team.py
   # Import from kickai/core/enums.py
   ```

3. **Fix RegistryType Enum**
   ```bash
   # Merge values: TOOL, COMMAND, SERVICE, AGENT, TASK
   # Keep in kickai/core/registry/base.py
   # Update registry_manager.py to use centralized enum
   ```

### Phase 2: Payment System Consolidation (Week 2)

4. **Consolidate Payment Enums**
   ```bash
   # Merge PaymentType values to include both fee types and payment methods
   # Merge PaymentStatus values to include all possible states
   # Update payment management domain to use centralized enums
   ```

5. **Consolidate ExpenseCategory**
   ```bash
   # Merge expense categories to include both general and football-specific categories
   # Update expense management to use centralized enum
   ```

### Phase 3: Health Monitoring Consolidation (Week 3)

6. **Consolidate Health Monitoring Enums**
   ```bash
   # Merge HealthStatus values
   # Merge ComponentType values
   # Update health monitoring domain to use centralized enums
   ```

7. **Consolidate Validation Enums**
   ```bash
   # Merge CheckStatus values
   # Merge CheckCategory values
   # Update startup validation to use centralized enums
   ```

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 4)

8. **Environment Enum**
   ```bash
   # Remove duplicate from settings.py
   # Import from kickai/core/enums.py
   ```

9. **AlertLevel Enum**
   ```bash
   # Remove duplicate from background_health_monitor.py
   # Import from kickai/core/enums.py
   ```

## Migration Strategy

### For Each Enum Consolidation:

1. **Backup current files**
2. **Create/update centralized enum** in `kickai/core/enums.py`
3. **Remove duplicate definitions** from feature-specific files
4. **Update imports** to use centralized enum
5. **Run comprehensive tests** to ensure functionality
6. **Update documentation** to reflect changes

### Testing Strategy:

- **Unit tests** for each enum to ensure values are correct
- **Integration tests** for features that use the enums
- **E2E tests** for critical workflows (player registration, payments, etc.)
- **Validation tests** to ensure enum values are consistent across the system

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Zero duplicate enum definitions
- ‚úÖ All imports use centralized enums
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Improved code maintainability

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backup all files** before making changes
- **Make changes incrementally** - one enum at a time
- **Test thoroughly** after each change
- **Have rollback plan** ready for each phase
- **Document all changes** for future reference
