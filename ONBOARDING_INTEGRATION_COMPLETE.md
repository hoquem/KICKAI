## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Delegation Pattern
All handlers now follow a consistent delegation pattern:

```python
# Primary: Use improved workflow
try:
    success, message = await improved_workflow.process_response(user_id, response)
    if success:
        return message
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error with improved workflow: {e}")

# Fallback: Use legacy workflow
try:
    success, message = await legacy_workflow.process_response(user_id, response)
    if success:
        return message
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error with legacy workflow: {e}")

# Final fallback: Error message
return "❌ Error processing onboarding response"
```

### Import Integration
All handlers now import and use the improved workflow:

```python
# Import improved onboarding workflow
from .onboarding_handler_improved import get_improved_onboarding_workflow

# Initialize in constructor
self.improved_workflow = get_improved_onboarding_workflow(team_id)

# Use in methods
success, message = await self.improved_workflow.process_response(user_id, response)
```
