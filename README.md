## 🏗️ Architecture

KICKAI follows a **Clean Architecture** with **Agentic-First Design** using CrewAI. The system is built around a **unified processing pipeline** where both slash commands and natural language converge to the same CrewAI orchestration system.

### **Unified Processing Architecture**

**Key Insight**: Both slash commands and natural language use the **exact same processing pipeline**.

#### **Processing Flow**
1. **Input Processing**: Handle both slash commands and natural language
2. **Command Registry**: Auto-discovery and metadata for slash commands  
3. **Unified Processing**: Both paths converge to `_handle_crewai_processing`
4. **CrewAI System**: Single orchestration pipeline for all requests
5. **Intent Classification**: Determine user intent (for both input types)
6. **Complexity Assessment**: Analyze request complexity
7. **Task Decomposition**: Break down into subtasks with agent assignments
8. **Agent Routing**: Route subtasks to appropriate agents
9. **Task Execution**: Execute tasks through specialized agents
10. **Result Aggregation**: Combine results and format response

#### **Benefits of Unified Processing**
- **🔒 Consistent Security**: Same permission checking for both input types
- **🔄 Single Source of Truth**: No code duplication between paths
- **🧪 Unified Testing**: Test once, works for both input methods
- **🛠️ Maintainable**: Single processing pipeline to maintain
- **📈 Scalable**: Easy to add new input methods (voice, buttons, etc.)
- **🎯 Consistent Behavior**: Same agent selection and execution logic

## 🔒 Security & Access Control

### **Unified Security Through Unified Processing**

The KICKAI system implements **comprehensive permission checking** through its unified processing pipeline. Since both slash commands and natural language use the same CrewAI orchestration system, security is automatically consistent.

#### **Security Features**
- **🔒 Unified Processing**: Both slash commands and natural language use the same security pipeline
- **🎯 Intent Mapping**: Natural language requests are mapped to equivalent commands for permission validation
- **👥 Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels (PUBLIC, PLAYER, LEADERSHIP, ADMIN, SYSTEM)
- **💬 Chat-Based Control**: Different permissions for main chat vs leadership chat
- **📊 Audit Logging**: All permission checks and access attempts are logged

#### **Permission Levels**
| Level | Description | Access |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **PUBLIC** | Available to everyone | Basic commands, help, version |
| **PLAYER** | Available to registered players | Player-specific commands |
| **LEADERSHIP** | Available to team leadership | Administrative commands |
| **ADMIN** | Available to team admins | System configuration |
| **SYSTEM** | Available to system only | Health checks, diagnostics |

#### **Security Flow**
1. **Input Processing**: User message (slash command or natural language)
2. **Unified Processing**: Both paths converge to same CrewAI system
3. **Intent Classification**: Determine what user wants to do
4. **Command Mapping**: Map natural language to equivalent command
5. **Permission Check**: Validate user permissions for the action
6. **Access Control**: Allow or deny based on permissions
7. **Agent Execution**: Only execute if permission check passes

#### **Benefits of Unified Security**
- **🔒 Consistent Protection**: Same security for all input methods
- **🔄 Single Security Logic**: No duplication of permission checking
- **🧪 Unified Testing**: Security tested once, works everywhere
- **🛠️ Maintainable**: Single security pipeline to maintain
- **📈 Scalable**: New input methods automatically inherit security
- **🎯 No Security Gaps**: Impossible to bypass through different input methods
