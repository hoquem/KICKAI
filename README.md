## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

KICKAI uses a **6-agent CrewAI architecture** with clean architecture principles. The system processes all user interactions through specialized AI agents using a unified pipeline.

### **6-Agent CrewAI System**
1. **MessageProcessorAgent** - Primary interface and routing
2. **HelpAssistantAgent** - Help system and guidance  
3. **PlayerCoordinatorAgent** - Player management
4. **TeamAdministrationAgent** - Team member management
5. **SquadSelectorAgent** - Squad selection and availability
6. **NLPProcessorAgent** - Natural language processing and understanding

### **Processing Flow**
```

### Architectural Principles: Embracing CrewAI Native Features

KICKAI is built with a strong commitment to leveraging the native capabilities and design patterns of the CrewAI framework. This approach ensures:

*   **Maintainability:** By adhering to CrewAI's conventions, the codebase remains consistent and easier to understand for anyone familiar with the framework.
*   **Scalability:** Native features are often optimized for performance and scalability, allowing the system to grow efficiently.
*   **Robustness:** Relying on well-tested CrewAI functionalities reduces the risk of introducing bugs or unexpected behavior.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Staying aligned with the framework's evolution makes upgrades and new feature integration smoother.

**Key Principles for CrewAI Usage:**

*   **Task Context (`Task.config`):** All context and parameters required by tools should be passed via the `Task.config` dictionary. Tools should retrieve their necessary inputs from this context.
*   **Native Memory:** Utilize CrewAI's built-in memory management features for persistent context across tasks and agents, rather than implementing custom memory solutions.
*   **Delegation and Orchestration:** Employ CrewAI's inherent delegation mechanisms for agents to collaborate and for complex tasks to be broken down and orchestrated.
*   **Agent and Task Design:** Adhere to CrewAI's recommended patterns for defining agent roles, goals, backstories, and structuring tasks.
*   **Avoid Reinvention:** Do not re-implement functionalities (e.g., task execution, agent communication, tool invocation) that are already provided and optimized by the CrewAI framework.

For detailed guidelines and examples, refer to the [CrewAI Best Practices Implementation Guide](CREWAI_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and the [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## üîí Security & Access Control

### **Unified Security Through Unified Processing**

The KICKAI system implements **comprehensive permission checking** through its unified processing pipeline. Since both slash commands and natural language use the same CrewAI orchestration system, security is automatically consistent.

#### **Security Features**
- **üîí Unified Processing**: Both slash commands and natural language use the same security pipeline
- **üéØ Intent Mapping**: Natural language requests are mapped to equivalent commands for permission validation
- **üë• Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels (PUBLIC, PLAYER, LEADERSHIP, ADMIN, SYSTEM)
- **üí¨ Chat-Based Control**: Different permissions for main chat vs leadership chat
- **üìä Audit Logging**: All permission checks and access attempts are logged

#### **Permission Levels**
| Level | Description | Access |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **PUBLIC** | Available to everyone | Basic commands, help, version |
| **PLAYER** | Available to registered players | Player-specific commands |
| **LEADERSHIP** | Available to team leadership | Administrative commands |
| **ADMIN** | Available to team admins | System configuration |
| **SYSTEM** | Available to system only | Health checks, diagnostics |

#### **Security Flow**
1. **Input Processing**: User message (slash command or natural language)
2. **Unified Processing**: Both paths converge to same CrewAI system
3. **Intent Classification**: Determine what user wants to do
4. **Command Mapping**: Map natural language to equivalent command
5. **Permission Check**: Validate user permissions for the action
6. **Access Control**: Allow or deny based on permissions
7. **Agent Execution**: Only execute if permission check passes

#### **Benefits of Unified Security**
- **üîí Consistent Protection**: Same security for all input methods
- **üîÑ Single Security Logic**: No duplication of permission checking
- **üß™ Unified Testing**: Security tested once, works everywhere
- **üõ†Ô∏è Maintainable**: Single security pipeline to maintain
- **üìà Scalable**: New input methods automatically inherit security
- **üéØ No Security Gaps**: Impossible to bypass through different input methods
