```

### Adding New Features

1. **Follow Feature-First Architecture**: Create new features in `src/features/`
2. **Implement Clean Architecture**: Follow the layered architecture pattern
3. **Write Comprehensive Tests**: Include unit, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Update Documentation**: Document new features and cross-feature flows
5. **Run Cross-Feature Tests**: Ensure new features work with existing flows

### Cross-Feature Development

When adding new features that interact with existing ones:

1. **Identify Cross-Feature Dependencies**: Map out interactions with other features
2. **Update Integration Tests**: Add tests for cross-feature interactions
3. **Add E2E Tests**: Test complete user journeys involving the new feature
4. **Validate Data Consistency**: Ensure state consistency across features
5. **Update Documentation**: Document new cross-feature flows
