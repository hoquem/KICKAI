## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Agentic Architecture**
KICKAI uses a sophisticated 7-agent CrewAI system with **unified execution interface**:

1. **Message Processor** - Primary user interface and command parsing
2. **Team Manager** - Strategic coordination and high-level planning
3. **Player Coordinator** - Operational player management and registration
4. **Performance Analyst** - Performance analysis and tactical insights
5. **Finance Manager** - Financial tracking and payment management
6. **Learning Agent** - Continuous learning and system improvement
7. **Onboarding Agent** - Specialized player onboarding and registration

### **Unified Agent Interface**
All agents now use a **standardized `execute()` method** for task execution:
- **Primary Interface**: `agent.execute(description, parameters)` - Unified execution method
- **Fallback Support**: Legacy methods (`execute_task`, `process`, `handle`) for backward compatibility
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed execution tracking with interface identification

### **Refined TaskExecutionOrchestrator**
The orchestrator now features:
- **Unified Interface Priority**: Primarily uses `agent.execute()` method
- **Intelligent Fallback System**: Graceful handling of legacy agent interfaces
- **Enhanced Metadata Tracking**: Execution interface type and agent type logging
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Clear error messages with available methods
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time tracking and analytics

### **Code Architecture**
KICKAI follows **Clean Architecture** principles with a **layered, feature-first organization**:

## Multi-Team Support and Dynamic Team ID Resolution

KICKAI now supports multiple teams (multi-tenancy) with dynamic team ID resolution for every incoming message. This ensures that all commands, onboarding, and role checks are scoped to the correct team, based on the context of the message.

### How Team ID is Determined
The system uses the following strategies (in order of priority):
1. **Bot Token**: If you run multiple bots, each with its own token, each can map to a different team.
2. **Bot Username**: Useful if you have multiple bots with different usernames.
3. **Chat ID**: If each team has its own group chat(s), the chat ID is mapped to a team.
4. **User Context**: (Future) If users can belong to multiple teams, this can be extended to query the database.
5. **Default Team ID**: Fallback if no mapping is found.

### Environment Variables
- `DEFAULT_TEAM_ID`: The fallback team ID (required for single-team setups).
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`: Used for mapping the bot to a team.
- `TELEGRAM_MAIN_CHAT_ID`, `TELEGRAM_LEADERSHIP_CHAT_ID`: Used for mapping chats to a team.
- `TEAM_MAPPINGS`: (Optional, advanced) JSON string for multiple teams. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "team1-id": {"bot_token": "token1", "bot_username": "bot1", "chat_ids": ["-100123", "-100124"]},
    "team2-id": {"bot_token": "token2", "bot_username": "bot2", "chat_ids": ["-100125"]}
  }
  ```

### How to Add More Teams
1. Add each team's bot token, username, and chat IDs to the `TEAM_MAPPINGS` JSON.
2. Set `DEFAULT_TEAM_ID` to the fallback team.
3. Restart the bot.

### Migration Guide
- Remove all hardcoded `team_id` values from your code.
- Use the new team mapping service for all team lookups.
- The system will log all loaded team mappings on startup for verification.

**KICKAI v1.7.0** - AI-Powered Football Team Management System with Unified Agent Interface

# KICKAI Telegram Bot

## Running the Bot

**Always run scripts from the project root with `PYTHONPATH=src`.**

Example:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python run_telegram_bot.py
```

This is required for all scripts at the project root to ensure imports work correctly. 

## 🚀 Recent Fixes (June 2024)

- All commands are now async for improved performance and reliability.
- Enum validation for player positions and onboarding statuses is robust; database cleanup script included.
- Registration logic improved: `/register` confirms if player ID matches, only shows conflict if not.
- Player info and registration confirmation now show FA registration and match eligibility status.
- All bot responses are plain text, no markdown, and consistently formatted.
- Access control is now chat-based, not role-based.
- Codebase cleaned up: removed unused code, improved error handling, and ensured code hygiene.

## 📅 Last Updated: June 2024
**Version:** 1.0.1
