# Project KICKAI: System Design & Feature Roadmap

## 1. Overview

**Project KICKAI** is an AI-powered management system for a Sunday League football team. It uses a CrewAI agent workforce to automate administrative and logistical tasks, a Supabase backend for data persistence, and a WhatsApp-based interface for easy interaction with players and managers.

## 2. System Architecture

The system will be composed of five primary components:

1.  **User Interface (WhatsApp):** This is how players and the manager interact with the system. We'll use the Twilio API for WhatsApp to send and receive messages. Players will be able to respond to simple commands (e.g., "Y" for available, "N" for unavailable, or "pay").

2.  **API Bridge (e.g., FastAPI/Flask on a server):** This is a lightweight web service that acts as the crucial link between WhatsApp (Twilio) and our CrewAI application. It receives webhooks, translates messages into tasks for the crew, and sends back the results.

3.  **Backend Logic (CrewAI):** This is the brain of the operation. We will define a "crew" of AI agents with specific roles to handle various tasks.

4.  **Database & Storage (Supabase):** This is our system's memory. It stores player info, fixtures, availability, team selections, match fees, fines, ratings, task assignments, and leaderboards.

5.  **Payment Gateway (Stripe):** To handle online payments for match fees and fines securely. The API bridge will communicate with Stripe to create payment links and confirm transactions.

## 3. CrewAI Agent Definitions

We'll expand our crew to handle the new responsibilities.

    * **Function:** Interacts directly with the Supabase database for player and fixture data.
    * **Tools:** `get_fixture_details`, `get_all_players`, `update_player_availability`, `get_player_availability_list`, `record_match_result`.
