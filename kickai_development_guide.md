## 🚨 **RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES**

### **If We Fall Behind:**
1. **Drop non-essential features** (advanced analytics, complex workflows)
2. **Focus on core functionality** only (registration, matches, availability, basic payments)
3. **Manual workarounds** for complex features initially
4. **Parallel development** - work on different features simultaneously

### **Daily Risk Assessment:**
- **Red Flag**: Missing daily targets or blocked > 4 hours
- **Yellow Flag**: Behind by 1 day or struggling with features
- **Green Flag**: On track or ahead of schedule

### **Emergency Escalation:**
- **Blocked > 4 hours**: Immediate WhatsApp call for help
- **Feature at risk**: Family emergency coding session
- **System issues**: All hands on deck until resolved

## 🔧 **Key Development Commands & Debugging**

### **Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
# Start bot safely for testing
./start_bot_safe.sh

# Check bot status
./check_bot_status.sh

# Run tests while developing
pytest tests/unit/features/your_feature/

# Check code quality
make lint                # Run ruff check, format, and mypy
make dev-workflow        # Complete development workflow

# View logs
tail -f logs/kickai.log

# Stop bot when done
./stop_bot.sh
```

### **Debugging Tools**
```bash
# Check bot status
./check_bot_status.sh
ps aux | grep python | grep run_bot_local

# Start bot safely
./start_bot_safe.sh

# Stop bot if needed
./stop_bot.sh

# Kill all bot processes (emergency)
./scripts/kill_bot_processes.sh

# Clear Python cache (when import issues persist)
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete && find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

# Test specific imports (activate environment first)
source venv311/bin/activate
python -c "from core.constants import BOT_VERSION"

# Health checks
make health-check
python scripts/run_health_checks.py
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # The start_bot_safe.sh script handles PYTHONPATH automatically
   ./start_bot_safe.sh
   
   # For manual testing, always use PYTHONPATH=src
   source venv311/bin/activate && PYTHONPATH=src python run_bot_local.py
   
   # Clear cache if needed
   find . -name "*.pyc" -delete && find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```

2. **Bot Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check for existing processes
   ./check_bot_status.sh
   ps aux | grep python | grep run_bot_local
   
   # Stop existing bot processes
   ./stop_bot.sh
   
   # Or kill all bot processes (emergency)
   ./scripts/kill_bot_processes.sh
   
   # Start bot safely
   ./start_bot_safe.sh
   
   # Check logs for issues
   tail -f logs/kickai.log
   ```

3. **CrewAI Agent Issues**
   - Use CrewAI native features only
   - No custom tool wrappers
   - Native parameter passing via Task.config
   - Tools return simple string responses
