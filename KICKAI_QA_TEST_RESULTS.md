## Critical Issues Identified

### 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**

1. **User Creation API Failure (422 Error)**
   - **Impact:** Cannot register new users through UI
   - **Error:** Unprocessable Entity - likely validation issue
   - **Recommendation:** Debug API validation logic and required field mappings

2. **Response Timeout on /myinfo Command**
   - **Impact:** Users cannot access personal information consistently  
   - **Issue:** Command sent but no response received
   - **Recommendation:** Investigate agent processing delays and timeout handling

### ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

3. **UI User Selection State Issue**
   - **Impact:** User selection not properly updating input placeholder
   - **Issue:** Input shows "Send message as Joe Bloggs..." even after selecting different user
   - **Recommendation:** Fix user selection state management in frontend

4. **Unknown Member Data Quality**
   - **Impact:** Multiple entries with "Unknown Member" names
   - **Issue:** System-generated users without proper names (member_1581500055, etc.)
   - **Recommendation:** Improve member data validation and name requirements

### 📝 **LOW PRIORITY**

5. **Duplicate Bot Responses**
   - **Impact:** Some commands showing duplicate responses in chat history
   - **Issue:** Multiple identical responses for single commands
   - **Recommendation:** Review message deduplication logic
