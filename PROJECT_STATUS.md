## **📋 Critical Lessons Learned**

### **1. Feature-First Architecture**
**Issue**: Monolithic structure with tight coupling
**Solution**: Feature-first modularization with clean architecture
**Key Files**:
- `kickai/features/` - 9 feature modules with domain/application/infrastructure layers
- `kickai/core/` - Shared core components
- `kickai/agents/` - AI agent system

**Rules**:
- ✅ Each feature is self-contained with clear boundaries
- ✅ Features interact only through interfaces and dependency injection
- ✅ Domain layer has no dependencies on other layers
- ✅ Application layer orchestrates domain and infrastructure

### **2. Entity-Specific Agent Routing**
**Issue**: Generic agent routing without context awareness
**Solution**: Entity-specific routing based on player vs team member operations
**Key Rules**:
- ✅ Player operations route to PlayerCoordinatorAgent
- ✅ Team member operations route to TeamManagerAgent
- ✅ Cross-entity operations route to MessageProcessorAgent
- ✅ Clear separation prevents data leakage between entities

### **3. Memory System Configuration**
**Issue**: Memory disabled due to compatibility issues
**Solution**: Re-enabled with Hugging Face embeddings for consistency
**Key Rules**:
- ✅ Use Hugging Face embeddings (consistent with LLM architecture)
- ✅ Memory enabled by default with proper configuration
- ✅ Fallback to Google embeddings if needed
- ✅ Memory configuration via environment variables

### **4. Multi-LLM Support**
**Issue**: Single LLM provider dependency
**Solution**: Multi-provider support with intelligent fallback
**Key Rules**:
- ✅ Hugging Face models as primary (cost-effective, consistent)
- ✅ Gemini as fallback (high-quality, reliable)
- ✅ OpenAI as alternative (when needed)
- ✅ Provider selection via environment configuration

### **5. Configuration Management**
**Issue**: Scattered configuration access and hardcoded values
**Solution**: Centralized Pydantic-based configuration system
**Key Rules**:
- ✅ Single source of truth for all configuration
- ✅ Type-safe configuration with validation
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
