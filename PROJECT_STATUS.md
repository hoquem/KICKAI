# KICKAI Project Status

## Overview
KICKAI is an AI-powered management system for a Sunday League football team. It uses CrewAI agents, a Supabase backend, and is designed for WhatsApp-based interaction. The system automates logistics, player management, squad selection, payments, and communications.

---

## System Architecture
- **User Interface:** WhatsApp (planned, not yet implemented)
- **API Bridge:** (planned, not yet implemented)
- **Backend Logic:** CrewAI agents (Python)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (planned, not yet implemented)

---

## Supabase Database Schema (Implemented)
- **players**: id, name, phone_number, is_active, created_at
- **fixtures**: id, opponent, match_date, location, is_home_game, result, created_at
- **availability**: id, player_id, fixture_id, status, squad_status, has_paid_fees, fine_incurred, fine_reason, fine_paid, created_at
- **ratings**: id, fixture_id, rated_player_id, rater_player_id, rating, comment, created_at
- **tasks**: id, name, description
- **task_assignments**: id, task_id, player_id, fixture_id, is_completed
- **equipment**: id, name, description, purchase_date, purchase_cost, current_holder_id, created_at

- **Default data**: Inserted for tasks and equipment

---

## Python Codebase (Implemented)
- **src/tools/supabase_tools.py**: Tools for player, fixture, and availability management (CRUD, squad, payments)
- **src/agents.py**: Five CrewAI agents (Logistics, Manager, Communications, Tactical, Finance) each with appropriate tools
- **src/tasks.py**: Task classes for player, fixture, availability, team management, and communication tasks
- **src/main.py**: Demo runner for CrewAI system, supports multiple demo scenarios (list players, fixtures, squad selection, etc.)
- **test_sample_data.py**: Script to populate the database with 14 players, 3 fixtures, and realistic availability/squad/payment data

---

## Sample Data (Loaded)
- **14 players** (all active, unique phone numbers)
- **3 fixtures** (upcoming, home/away)
- **Availability**: All players have status for first fixture (Available/Unavailable/Maybe)
- **Squad**: 11 starters, 3 substitutes for first fixture
- **Payments**: 10 players marked as paid

---

## CrewAI Agents (Implemented)
- **Logistics Coordinator**: Handles all data management (players, fixtures, availability)
- **Team Manager**: High-level management, squad selection, team status
- **Communications Officer**: Messaging, announcements, reminders
- **Tactical Assistant**: Squad selection, tactical analysis
- **Finance Manager**: Payment tracking, financial reports

---

## CrewAI Tasks (Implemented)
- **PlayerTasks**: Add, list, get, update players
- **FixtureTasks**: Add, list, get, update fixtures
- **AvailabilityTasks**: Set/get availability, squad, payments
- **TeamManagementTasks**: Analyze availability, squad selection, payment report, team status
- **CommunicationTasks**: Availability request, squad announcement, fixture reminder, payment reminder

---

## Current Demo/Testing Status
- **main.py** supports 8 demo scenarios (change `demo_choice` to test different flows)
- **All tools and agents are wired up and functional**
- **LLM (Google Gemini) integration is set up but currently failing due to API/auth issues**
- **Supabase integration is fully working**

---

## Outstanding/Next Steps
- **Fix LLM (Gemini) API key or quota issues** to enable full CrewAI agent reasoning
- **Implement WhatsApp API bridge** for real user interaction
- **Add tools for ratings, tasks, equipment (if needed)**
- **Expand test coverage and error handling**
- **Integrate Stripe for payments**
- **Polish user experience and documentation**

---

## How to Resume Development
1. **Check this file for context and current state**
2. **Review the sample data and schema in Supabase**
3. **Test the LLM connection with a minimal script if needed**
4. **Continue with WhatsApp/API bridge or feature expansion as required**

---

## Quick Reference
- **Run main system:** `python src/main.py` (from project root)
- **Add sample data:** `python test_sample_data.py`
- **Agents/tasks/tools:** See `src/agents.py`, `src/tasks.py`, `src/tools/supabase_tools.py`
- **Database schema:** See SQL scripts in Supabase or summary above
