# KICKAI Changelog

## [2025-01-XX] - LLM-Based Intent Recognition

### ðŸš€ Major Improvements

#### Natural Language Understanding
- **Replaced regex-based intent recognition with pure LLM-based approach**
  - Eliminated brittle regex patterns that couldn't handle natural language variations
  - Implemented `LLMIntentRecognizer` using CrewAI agents for sophisticated understanding
  - Added context-aware intent recognition that considers user roles and chat types
  - Improved entity extraction with LLM reasoning capabilities

#### New Features
- **`LLMIntentRecognizer` class**: Pure LLM-based intent recognition
  - Uses CrewAI agents for sophisticated natural language understanding
  - Provides confidence scoring based on LLM analysis
  - Includes reasoning explanations for intent classification
  - Handles context, paraphrases, and complex natural language

- **Enhanced entity extraction**: 
  - Extracts entities like player names, positions, phone numbers
  - Understands relationships and context in natural language
  - Provides structured output with confidence scores

- **Context-aware processing**:
  - Considers user registration status, chat type, and team context
  - Adapts intent recognition based on user role (player vs team member)
  - Handles different chat contexts (main vs leadership)

#### Technical Improvements
- **Structured output**: Uses JSON format for consistent parsing
- **Error handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for parsing failures
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing code
- **Async support**: Full async/await support for better performance

#### Files Modified
- `kickai/utils/llm_intent.py`: Complete rewrite with LLM-based approach
- `kickai/utils/llm_client.py`: Updated to use new intent recognizer
- `scripts/test_llm_intent.py`: New test script for intent recognition

### ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with regex patterns missing natural language variations
- Improved handling of ambiguous user requests
- Better error handling for intent extraction failures

### ðŸ“š Documentation
- Added comprehensive test script demonstrating LLM-based intent recognition
- Updated inline documentation for all new classes and methods
- Added examples of natural language processing capabilities

### ðŸ§ª Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite for intent recognition
- Added tests for context awareness and entity extraction
- Included test cases for complex and ambiguous natural language
