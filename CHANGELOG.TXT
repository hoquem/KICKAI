# KICKAI Project Changelog

## [Latest] - 2025-08-28

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Dependency Container Initialization Fix**: Fixed issue where player update tools were failing due to uninitialized dependency container. Added container initialization checks to `update_player_field` and `get_my_status` tools to ensure services are available before use.
- **Position Update Persistence**: Resolved issue where `/update position` command appeared successful but position changes were not persisted. The fix ensures the dependency container is fully initialized before tools attempt to access services.

### 🧪 Testing
- **Tool Functionality Validation**: Verified that position updates are correctly saved to the database and `/myinfo` command reads updated positions correctly.

## [Previous] - 2025-08-28

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Help Tools Fix**: Resolved `/list` command failure by fixing application layer tools to call domain functions directly instead of non-existent service methods.
- **Service Registration and Tool Validation**: Fixed asynchronous dependency container initialization, duplicate tool registrations, and command conflicts.
- **Comprehensive Validator Code Quality**: Improved import order, type safety, error handling, and overall maintainability.
- **Registry Validator Code Quality**: Enhanced type safety, error handling, detailed logging, and validation logic.
- **Startup Validator Code Quality**: Improved code structure, error handling, and documentation.

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Intent-Based Delegation**: Removed hardcoded routing rules from manager agent, implementing pure intent-based delegation using LLM intelligence.
- **Type Safety and Error Handling**: Enhanced `crew_lifecycle_manager.py` with custom exceptions, protocols, and comprehensive type annotations.
- **CrewAI Delegation Parameter Fix**: Fixed manager agent delegation to use simple string parameters instead of dictionaries.
- **Manager Agent Tools**: Ensured manager agent has no execution tools (tools=[]) for proper hierarchical delegation.

### 📚 Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated to reflect 5-agent system with native CrewAI routing and manager agent architecture.
- **.cursor/rules**: Updated documentation to reflect new architecture and best practices.
- **CHANGELOG.TXT**: Comprehensive tracking of all changes and improvements.

### 🔄 Code Refactoring
- **CrewAI Agents Simplification**: Reduced `crew_agents.py` complexity by 67% by leveraging CrewAI's native delegation.
- **Team Memory Compatibility**: Fixed `team_memory` attribute access in lifecycle manager for simplified system compatibility.

### 🚀 System Improvements
- **LLM Configuration**: Fixed manager agent to use configured LLM instead of defaulting to OpenAI.
- **Native CrewAI Routing**: Migrated from explicit NLP processing to CrewAI's built-in hierarchical delegation.
- **Tool Distribution**: Redistributed tools from MESSAGE_PROCESSOR to HELP_ASSISTANT for proper hierarchical setup.
