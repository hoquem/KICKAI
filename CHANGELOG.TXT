## [2025-01-XX] - ChatType Enum Fix, CrewAI Agents Refactoring, Required Chat ID Parameters, LLM-Based Intent Recognition, Async Utils & Tool Registry Code Quality

### 🔧 Critical Fixes

FILES MODIFIED
ChatType Enum Error Fix
- Fixed `'str' object has no attribute 'value'` error in AgenticMessageRouter and Tools:
  - Root Cause: Functions expecting `ChatType` enum were receiving string values instead, and tools were calling `create_json_response()` with string values instead of `ResponseStatus` enum
  - Impact: Caused tool execution failures and system errors across multiple tools (ping, version, help tools)
  - Solution: Added robust type checking and conversion in `_check_command_availability()` and `_handle_unrecognized_command()` functions, and fixed all `create_json_response()` calls to use proper enum values
  - Implementation: Added `isinstance(chat_type, str)` checks with proper enum conversion using `normalize_chat_type()`, and updated all tool responses to use `ResponseStatus.SUCCESS` and `ResponseStatus.ERROR`
  - Fallback: Default to `ChatType.MAIN` if conversion fails
  - Logging: Added warning logs when string-to-enum conversion occurs
  - Error Prevention: Prevents future similar errors with proper type validation

- Specific fixes:
  - Fixed `_check_command_availability()` function to handle string chat_type parameters
  - Fixed `_handle_unrecognized_command()` function to handle string chat_type parameters
