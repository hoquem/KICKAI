# KICKAI Project Changelog

## [Latest] - 2025-08-28

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Mock UI Connection Fix**: Fixed mock Telegram UI connection issue by updating all references from port 8000 to port 8001 to match the actual mock server configuration. Updated mock_tester.html, test files, constants, and documentation to use the correct port. Added cache-busting parameters and no-cache meta tags to prevent browser caching issues.
- **Mock Invite Link Processing Fix**: Fixed issue where mock Telegram service was not updating player records in Firestore with telegram_id during invite link processing. The mock service now properly updates the player's telegram_id field when processing player invites, ensuring that /myinfo and other player tools can find the player correctly.
- **Real Telegram Invite Link Processing**: Implemented proper new_chat_members handler in real Telegram bot service to handle invite link processing and update player records with telegram_id. Added support for new_chat_members data in TelegramMessage class and AgenticMessageRouter.
- **Team Member Invite Link Processing**: Extended real Telegram bot service to handle team member invite link processing and update team member records with telegram_id when they join the leadership chat via invite links.
- **Team-Specific Collection Naming Fix**: Fixed issue where some invite link operations were using global collection names instead of team-specific ones. Updated PlayerToolService to create team-specific InviteLinkService instances for proper collection naming.
- **Player Status Activation Fix**: Fixed issue where invite link processing was setting telegram_id but not updating player status to 'active'. Both real Telegram and mock services now properly activate players when they join via invite links.
- **Response Formatting Consistency Fix**: Fixed inconsistent response formatting between /myinfo and /update commands. Updated update_player_field tool to use create_tool_response instead of create_json_response for consistent, clean message formatting without escaped quotes and extra newlines.
- **Shared Tools Response Formatting Update**: Updated all shared module tools to use create_tool_response for consistent formatting. Updated help_tools, user_tools, system_tools, and permission_tools to use the cleaner response format that prevents escaping issues and provides better user experience.
- **Team Administration Tools Response Formatting Update**: Completed updating all team administration tools to use create_tool_response. Updated player_management_tools, team_management_tools, team_member_tools, approve_tools, and team_administration_tools for consistent formatting and better user experience.
- **Dependency Container Initialization Fix**: Fixed issue where player update tools were failing due to uninitialized dependency container. Added container initialization checks to `update_player_field` and `get_my_status` tools to ensure services are available before use.
- **Position Update Persistence**: Resolved issue where `/update position` command appeared successful but position changes were not persisted. The fix ensures the dependency container is fully initialized before tools attempt to access services.

### 🧪 Testing
- **Tool Functionality Validation**: Verified that position updates are correctly saved to the database and `/myinfo` command reads updated positions correctly.
