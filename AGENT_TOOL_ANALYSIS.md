## Agent Functionality Status

| Agent | Working Tools | Missing Tools | Functionality |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **message_processor** | 4/8 (50%) | 4 | **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL** |
| **help_assistant** | 2/3 (67%) | 1 | **MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL** |
| **player_coordinator** | 4/6 (67%) | 2 | **MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL** |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **DO NOT DELETE** any tools until missing tools are implemented
2. **Implement `send_message`** first (used by 4 agents)
3. **Implement `send_announcement`** second (used by 2 agents)
4. **Fix team_administrator** agent (currently non-functional)

### Tool Cleanup Strategy
1. **Keep all existing tools** until missing tools are implemented
2. **Re-evaluate unused tools** after implementing missing tools
3. **Consider tool consolidation** after full implementation
4. **Test agent functionality** after each tool implementation

### Missing Tool Implementation Priority
1. **Communication Tools** (send_message, send_announcement) - Critical for all agents
2. **Core Functionality Tools** (get_user_status, team_member_registration, list_matches)
3. **Enhancement Tools** (get_welcome_message, send_poll)
