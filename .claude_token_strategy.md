# Token Minimization Strategy

## Core Principles
1. **Concise responses** - No unnecessary explanations
2. **Direct actions** - Execute tasks without preamble
3. **Minimal output** - Show only essential information
4. **Batch operations** - Combine multiple edits/reads when possible
5. **Smart file operations** - Read only necessary sections, not entire files

## Implementation Rules
- Use MultiEdit over multiple Edit calls
- Limit file reads with offset/limit parameters for large files
- Avoid verbose test outputs - summarize results
- Skip redundant confirmations
- Use grep/glob for targeted searches instead of reading multiple files
- Minimize traceback outputs - show only relevant error lines

## Response Format
- Lead with action, not explanation
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- Omit "I will..." statements
- Show file paths without full content previews
- Summarize changes instead of showing full diffs

## Saved for all future interactions
