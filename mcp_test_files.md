# MCP File System Server Test

This file is used to test the MCP File System server functionality in Cursor.

## Test Scenarios

1. **File Reading**: The AI should be able to read this file
2. **Directory Listing**: The AI should be able to list project directories
3. **File Search**: The AI should be able to search for specific files
4. **Code Analysis**: The AI should be able to analyze code files

## Project Structure

The KICKAI project has the following main directories:
- `kickai/` - Main application code
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `setup/` - Setup and configuration

## Test Commands

Once the MCP server is configured in Cursor, you can test it by asking:

- "List the files in the kickai directory"
- "Show me the contents of kickai/__init__.py"
- "Find all Python files in the project"
- "What's in the docs directory?"

## Expected Behavior

The AI should be able to:
- Navigate through your file system
- Read file contents
- List directories
- Search for files
- Analyze code structure

This demonstrates the power of MCP servers in providing AI assistants with direct access to your development environment.
