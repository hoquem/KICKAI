print("\n3. 🔄 Summary of Changes Made:")
print("✅ Replaced hardcoded team_id 'TEST1' with dynamic lookup")
print("✅ Added _get_available_team_id() function for data-driven team_id")
print("✅ Modified Mock Telegram to load users from Firestore")
print("✅ Added _load_users_from_firestore() for dynamic user loading")
print("✅ Added _get_team_name_from_firestore() for dynamic team names")
print("✅ System now queries kickai_players and kickai_team_members collections")

print("\n4. 🎯 Expected Impact:")
print("• Bot will use actual Firestore team_id (e.g., 'KTI') instead of 'TEST1'")
print("• User lookup will match actual telegram_ids from Firestore")
print("• AgenticMessageRouter will find registered users correctly")
print("• Messages will route through CrewAI agents instead of showing 'not registered'")
print("• Groq API calls should now appear in the dashboard")

print("\n5. ⚠️ Known Issues:")
print("• Dependencies (firebase_admin, fastapi) missing in current environment")
print("• Full testing requires proper Python environment with all dependencies")
print("• Need to test with actual Mock Telegram service running")

print("\n🎉 CONCLUSION: System has been successfully converted to data-driven!")
print("The hardcoded values have been removed and replaced with dynamic Firestore queries.")
