3. Add the Railway token and environment-specific secrets listed above

### 2. Test CI/CD Pipeline
1. Push a change to the `development` branch
2. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Verify automatic deployment to testing environment

### 3. Configure Staging and Production
1. Set up environment variables for staging and production Railway projects
2. Test manual deployments using GitHub Actions workflow dispatch

### 4. Set Up Monitoring
1. Configure Railway alerts for service downtime
2. Set up GitHub Actions notifications for deployment failures
3. Monitor health endpoints regularly
