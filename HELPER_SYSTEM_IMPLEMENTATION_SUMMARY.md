## Core Components

### 1. Helper Agent (`kickai/agents/helper_agent.py`)

The central AI agent that provides intelligent assistance:

- **Role**: HELPER_ASSISTANT
- **Goal**: Guide team members to become proficient KICKAI users
- **Capabilities**:
  - Command guidance and examples
  - Feature discovery and recommendations
  - Task reminders and suggestions
  - Learning progress tracking
  - Contextual help and troubleshooting
  - Achievement celebrations
  - Proactive assistance

### 2. Domain Services

#### LearningAnalyticsService
- Tracks user command usage and learning progress
- Calculates experience levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert)
- Provides personalized learning recommendations
- Generates team and user analytics
- Monitors learning velocity and feature adoption

#### GuidanceService
- Provides contextual help for commands and features
- Generates personalized feature suggestions
- Formats help responses with emojis and clear structure
- Offers level-specific tips and best practices
- Maintains comprehensive help content library

#### ReminderService
- Creates and manages learning reminders
- Sends proactive suggestions based on user activity
- Schedules periodic reminders for engagement
- Tracks reminder effectiveness

### 3. Domain Entities

#### LearningProfile
- Tracks user's learning progress and preferences
- Stores command usage statistics
- Maintains experience level and learning velocity
- Records help request history

#### HelpRequest
- Represents user help requests
- Tracks request status and resolution
- Stores user feedback and ratings
- Enables analytics on help effectiveness

#### ProgressMetrics
- Quantifies user learning progress

### 4. Infrastructure

#### Firebase Repositories
- **FirebaseLearningProfileRepository**: Manages learning profiles in Firestore
- **FirebaseHelpRequestRepository**: Handles help request storage and retrieval

Both repositories implement comprehensive CRUD operations and analytics capabilities.

## Available Commands

The Helper System responds to these commands:

- `/helpme` - Get personalized help and guidance
- `/learn` - Get learning guidance and progress tracking
- `/progress` - Check your learning progress and achievements
- `/suggest` - Get personalized feature suggestions

## Integration Points

### 1. Agentic Message Router
The system integrates with the existing agentic message router to:
- Detect helper commands and route them to the Helper Agent
- Track user actions for learning analytics
- Provide proactive suggestions based on user behavior

### 2. Dependency Container
All services are properly registered in the dependency container:
- LearningAnalyticsService
- GuidanceService
- ReminderService
- LearningProfileRepositoryInterface
- HelpRequestRepositoryInterface

### 3. CrewAI Tools
The Helper Agent uses specialized tools:
- `get_command_help` - Detailed command assistance
- `get_feature_recommendations` - Personalized feature suggestions
- `track_user_progress` - Progress tracking
- `get_contextual_suggestions` - Context-aware help
- `celebrate_progress` - Achievement recognition

## Data Storage

### Firestore Collections
- `kickai_{team_id}_learning_profiles` - User learning profiles
- `kickai_{team_id}_help_requests` - Help request history

### Data Structure
- Learning profiles include command usage, experience level, and progress metrics
- Help requests track status, resolution time, and user feedback
- All data is team-scoped for proper isolation

## Testing
