### 1. **Proactive Monitoring**
```python
# Example: Monitor user behavior for proactive assistance
async def monitor_user_behavior(user_id: str, team_id: str, action: str):
    """Monitor user behavior and trigger proactive assistance when needed."""
    
    # Track the action
    await learning_analytics.track_user_action(user_id, team_id, action)
    
    # Check if proactive assistance is needed
    if should_provide_assistance(user_id, team_id, action):
        await trigger_proactive_assistance(user_id, team_id, action)
```

### 2. **Context-Aware Suggestions**
```python
# Example: Generate context-aware suggestions
async def get_contextual_suggestions(user_id: str, team_id: str, context: str):
    """Generate suggestions based on current user context."""
    
    profile = await get_user_profile(user_id, team_id)
    suggestions = await suggestion_service.get_contextual_suggestions(
        user_id, team_id, context
    )
    
    return format_suggestions(suggestions, profile.experience_level)
```

### 3. **Learning Progress Tracking**
```python
# Example: Track and celebrate learning progress
async def track_learning_progress(user_id: str, team_id: str, command: str):
    """Track command usage and celebrate progress milestones."""
    
    # Track the command usage
    await learning_analytics.track_command_usage(user_id, team_id, command)
    
    # Check for level-up opportunities
    if await learning_analytics.check_level_up(user_id, team_id):
