def check_system_ping() -> str:  # No parameters needed

@tool("check_system_version") 
def check_system_version() -> str:  # No parameters needed

@tool("get_system_commands")
async def get_system_commands(
    chat_type: str,    # Only needs chat type for context
    username: str = "user"  # Optional for personalization
) -> str:
```

#### **✅ GOOD - Appropriate Parameters**
```python
# PLAYER_COORDINATOR tools - only necessary context
@tool("get_player_self")
async def get_player_self(
    telegram_id: str,      # NEEDED - identifies user
    team_id: str,          # NEEDED - scopes to team
    telegram_username: str, # NEEDED - for display
    chat_type: str         # NEEDED - affects behavior
) -> str:

@tool("get_player_by_identifier")
async def get_player_by_identifier(
    telegram_id: str,      # NEEDED - for permission check
    team_id: str,          # NEEDED - scopes to team
    telegram_username: str, # NEEDED - for logging
    chat_type: str,        # NEEDED - for context
    player_identifier: str # NEEDED - who to look up
) -> str:
```

#### **⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - Unnecessary Parameters**
```python
# Some tools have parameters they don't actually use
@tool("send_team_announcement")
async def send_team_announcement(
    telegram_id: str,  # ❌ NOT used in the function
    team_id: str,      # ✅ NEEDED
    username: str,     # ❌ NOT used in the function  
    chat_type: str,    # ✅ NEEDED for permission check
    announcement: str  # ✅ NEEDED
) -> str:
```

### **Documentation Quality Analysis**

#### **✅ EXCELLENT - Clear "USE THIS FOR" Guidance**
```python
@tool("get_player_self")
async def get_player_self(...) -> str:
    """Retrieve the current user's own player profile including status, position, and contact details.
    
    USE THIS FOR:
    - /myinfo command → user requesting their own player information
    - "what is my status" → self-referential status queries
    - "show my player details" → first-person information requests
    - "am I active" → self-status confirmation queries
    - "my position" → user asking about their own role
    - "my contact info" → user checking their own details
    
    DO NOT USE FOR:
    - "show John's info" → use get_player_by_identifier instead
    - "what is player M001 status" → use get_player_by_identifier instead
    - /info [any_name] → use get_player_by_identifier for lookups
    - "list all players" → use list_players_active or list_players_all
    
    SEMANTIC PATTERN: The '_self' suffix indicates this tool ONLY retrieves data about the requesting user themselves.
    """
```

#### **⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - Generic Documentation**
```python
@tool("assign_member_role")
async def assign_member_role(...) -> str:
    """
    Grant specific administrative role to team member.

    Expands member's organizational responsibilities by assigning additional
    permissions and duties within the team's governance structure.

    Use when: Member role expansion is required
    Required: Administrative privileges
    Context: Team governance workflow

    Returns: Role assignment confirmation
    """
    # ❌ Missing specific "USE THIS FOR" examples
    # ❌ Missing "DO NOT USE FOR" guidance
    # ❌ Missing semantic pattern explanation
```

### **Error Handling Analysis**

#### **✅ EXCELLENT - Comprehensive Error Handling**
```python
try:
    # Get domain service through dependency injection with availability check
    container = get_container()
    try:
        system_service = container.get_service(ISystemService)
        if not system_service:
            return "❌ System service is not available"
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"❌ Failed to get system service: {e}")
        return "❌ System service is not available"
    
    # Execute pure business logic with graceful error handling
    try:
        ping_result = system_service.perform_ping()
        formatted_response = system_service.format_ping_response(ping_result)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"⚠️ System ping operation failed: {e}")
        return f"⚠️ System ping operation failed: {str(e)}"
    
    logger.info(f"✅ Ping response completed in {ping_result.response_time}ms")
    return formatted_response
    
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Error in ping tool: {e}")
    return f"❌ System ping failed: {str(e)}"
```

#### **⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - Basic Error Handling**
```python
try:
    # Basic error handling without service availability checks
    service = get_container().get_service(IService)
    result = await service.operation()
    return result
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
    return f"Failed: {str(e)}"
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**
