# Command Chat Differences

This document details the clean design approach for command behavior differences between main chat and leadership chat, using separate implementations rather than conditional logic. All messages use plain text with emojis for maximum reliability.

## Overview

The KICKAI system follows clean software engineering principles by using **separate implementations** for commands in different chat contexts, rather than conditional logic within a single handler. This ensures predictable behavior and maintainable code.

## Clean Design Principles

### **Separate Implementations vs Conditional Logic**

#### **‚ùå Avoid: Conditional Logic in Single Handler**
```python
@command("/list")
async def handle_list(update, context):
    chat_type = get_chat_type(update.effective_chat.id)
    
    if chat_type == "main":
        # Main chat logic
        players = await get_active_players()
        return format_simple_list(players)
    elif chat_type == "leadership":
        # Leadership chat logic
        players = await get_all_players()
        return format_detailed_list(players)
    else:
        # Error handling
        return "Invalid chat type"
```

#### **‚úÖ Prefer: Separate Implementations for Each Context**
```python
@command(name="/list", description="List active players", chat_type="main")
async def list_players_main(update, context):
    """List only active players in main chat."""
    players = await get_active_players()
    return format_player_list(players, show_status=False)

@command(name="/list", description="List all players with status", chat_type="leadership")
async def list_players_leadership(update, context):
    """List all players with detailed status in leadership chat."""
    players = await get_all_players()
    return format_player_list(players, show_status=True, show_details=True)
```

## Command Behavior Differences

| Command | Main Chat Implementation | Leadership Chat Implementation | Key Differences |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **üìã PUBLIC COMMANDS** |
| `/help` | Player-focused help | Admin-focused help | Context-aware command filtering |
| `/start` | Welcome message for new users | Welcome message for new users | Same behavior in both chats |
| `/register` | Player registration process | Player registration process | Same behavior in both chats |
| **üë• PLAYER COMMANDS** |
| `/list` | Shows only active players | Shows all players with status | Leadership chat shows more detailed information |
| `/myinfo` | Personal player information | Personal player information | Same behavior in both chats |
| `/update` | Update personal information | Update personal information | Same behavior in both chats |
| `/status` | Check own status or by phone | Check own status or by phone | Same behavior in both chats |

## Implementation Examples

### **Example 1: `/help` Command**

#### **Main Chat Implementation**
```python
@command(name="/help", description="Show help", chat_type="main")
async def help_main(update, context):
    """Show player-focused help in main chat."""
    return format_help_message(
        context=context,
        show_player_commands=True,
        show_admin_commands=False,
        show_registration_help=True
    )
```

#### **Leadership Chat Implementation**
```python
@command(name="/help", description="Show admin help", chat_type="leadership")
async def help_leadership(update, context):
    """Show admin-focused help in leadership chat."""
    return format_help_message(
        context=context,
        show_player_commands=True,
        show_admin_commands=True,
        show_registration_help=False
    )
```

### **Example 2: `/status` Command**

#### **Main Chat Implementation**
```python
@command(name="/status", description="Check player status", chat_type="main")
async def status_main(update, context):
    """Check own status in main chat."""
    user_id = update.effective_user.id
    player = await get_player_by_user_id(user_id)
    return format_player_status(player, show_details=False)
```

#### **Leadership Chat Implementation**
```python
@command(name="/status", description="Check any player status", chat_type="leadership")
async def status_leadership(update, context):
    """Check any player's status in leadership chat."""
    phone = context.args[0] if context.args else None
    player = await get_player_by_phone(phone)
    return format_player_status(player, show_details=True)
```

## Command Registration with Context

Commands are registered with explicit context information:

```python
# Command registry supports context-aware registration
registry.register_command(
    name="/list",
    description="List players",
    handler=list_players_main,
    chat_type="main",
    permission_level=PermissionLevel.PLAYER
)

registry.register_command(
    name="/list", 
    description="List all players with status",
    handler=list_players_leadership,
    chat_type="leadership",
    permission_level=PermissionLevel.LEADERSHIP
)
```

## Context-Aware Routing

The system routes commands to the appropriate implementation based on context:

```python
async def route_command(self, command_name: str, chat_type: str, update, context):
    """Route command to context-specific implementation."""
    # Find the appropriate handler for this command and context
    handler = self.registry.get_command_handler(command_name, chat_type)
    
    if handler:
        return await handler(update, context)
    else:
        return await self.fallback_handler(update, context)
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### **üéØ Predictable Behavior**
- Same command always behaves the same way in the same context
- No hidden conditional logic that could change behavior unexpectedly

### **üßπ Clean Code**
- Each implementation has a single responsibility
- Easy to understand and maintain
- No complex if/else chains

### **üìã Clear Intent**
- Each implementation clearly states its purpose
- Self-documenting code through function names and docstrings

### **üõ†Ô∏è Maintainable**
- Easy to modify behavior for specific contexts
- Changes to one context don't affect others
- Clear separation of concerns

### **üß™ Testable**
- Each implementation can be tested independently
- No need to test complex conditional logic
- Clear test scenarios for each context

### **üìà Scalable**
- Easy to add new contexts (e.g., private chat, group chat)
- New commands can follow the same pattern
- Consistent architecture across the system

## Permission Context Differences

### User Role Resolution

**Main Chat:**
- User must have `player` role to access PLAYER commands
- Role is determined by chat membership and team member record
- Limited to player-level permissions

**Leadership Chat:**
- User can have multiple roles (`player`, `team_member`, `admin`)
- Role is determined by chat membership and team member record
- Access to higher-level permissions based on roles

### Command Availability

**Main Chat:**
- PUBLIC commands: Always available
- PLAYER commands: Available to players
- LEADERSHIP commands: Not available
- ADMIN commands: Not available

**Leadership Chat:**
- PUBLIC commands: Always available
- PLAYER commands: Available to players
- LEADERSHIP commands: Available to team_member or admin
- ADMIN commands: Available to admin only

## Security Implications

### Data Access

**Main Chat:**
- Users can only access their own personal information
- Team information is limited to active players
- No access to administrative functions

**Leadership Chat:**
- Users can access team-wide information based on their role
- Administrative functions available to appropriate roles
- Full access to team management capabilities

### Command Execution

**Main Chat:**
- Commands execute with player-level permissions
- Limited to self-service and information retrieval
- No administrative actions possible

**Leadership Chat:**
- Commands execute with user's highest available role
- Full administrative capabilities for appropriate roles
- Team management and administrative actions available

## User Experience Differences

### Information Display

**Main Chat:**
- Simplified information display
- Focus on essential information
- User-friendly messaging

**Leadership Chat:**
- Detailed information display
- Administrative details included
- Professional management interface

### Error Messages

**Main Chat:**
- Simple error messages
- Focus on user guidance
- Limited technical details

**Leadership Chat:**
- Detailed error messages
- Technical information included
- Administrative troubleshooting guidance

## Best Practices
