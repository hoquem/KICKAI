## 🔧 **Architectural Improvements Implemented**

### **✅ Problems Resolved:**

1. **Tool Class Attribute Issues**: Fixed all tool classes to have proper class-level attributes (`logger`, `team_id`, `command_operations`) with correct Pydantic Field annotations.

2. **Agent Routing System Failures**: 
   - Fixed `Subtask.from_dict` method issues by creating proper Subtask objects directly
   - Added robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
   - Resolved import issues with `Subtask` and `CapabilityType` classes

3. **Architectural Role Clarification**:
   - **Formalized `TeamManagementSystem.execute_task`** as the central orchestrator for all commands
   - **Clarified `MessageProcessorAgent`** role: focuses solely on parsing and initial context extraction
   - **Updated `TeamManagerAgent`** delegation scope: handles sub-tasks from its own administrative duties, not as primary router

4. **Intent Classification Improvements**:
   - Added missing `agent_used` field to intent results
   - Improved intent classification with proper error handling
   - Enhanced user preference learning system
