# User Linking Strategy: Telegram ↔ Firestore

**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Status:** Analysis Complete  
**Issue:** Linking Telegram users to Firestore player records

## Problem Statement

When a player is added via `/addplayer`, the system creates a Firestore record with:
- Player ID (e.g., `MH1`)
- Name, phone number, position
- **Missing**: `telegram_id` and `username`

When the player later joins the main chat via invite link, the system cannot automatically link them to their existing Firestore record because the `telegram_id` field is null.

## Current Data Flow

### 1. **Player Addition via `/addplayer`**
```json
{
  "document_id": "MH1",
  "player_id": "MH1",
  "user_id": "user_KTI_+447961103217", 
  "full_name": "Mahmudul Hoque",
  "phone_number": "+447961103217",
  "position": "Defender",
  "team_id": "KTI",
  "status": "pending",
  "telegram_id": null,        // ❌ MISSING
  "username": null,           // ❌ MISSING
  "source": "manual_entry"
}
```

### 2. **User Joins Main Chat**
```python
# When user joins, system creates new player record
telegram_id = "123456789"
username = "@mahmudul_hoque"

# System cannot find existing record because telegram_id is null
existing_player = await get_player_by_telegram_id(telegram_id, team_id)  # Returns None
```

### 3. **Result: Duplicate Records**
- **Record 1**: Created by `/addplayer` (no telegram_id)
- **Record 2**: Created when user joins (with telegram_id)
- **Problem**: Two separate records for the same person

## Linking Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Phone Number Linking (Recommended)**

Use the phone number as the primary linking field since it's available in both scenarios.

#### Implementation:
```python
async def link_telegram_user_to_player(telegram_id: str, username: str, team_id: str) -> Player | None:
    """Link Telegram user to existing player record using phone number."""
    
    # 1. Check if user already has a player record with telegram_id
    existing_player = await get_player_by_telegram_id(telegram_id, team_id)
    if existing_player:
        return existing_player
    
    # 2. Look for pending players without telegram_id (added via /addplayer)
    pending_players = await get_players_by_status(team_id, "pending")
    
    # 3. Prompt user to provide phone number for linking
    # This would be handled in the chat flow
    return None

async def link_player_by_phone(phone: str, telegram_id: str, username: str, team_id: str) -> Player | None:
    """Link player record by phone number."""
    
    # Find player with matching phone number
    player = await get_player_by_phone(phone, team_id)
    if player and not player.telegram_id:
        # Update the existing record with Telegram info
        player.telegram_id = telegram_id
        player.username = username
        player.user_id = generate_user_id(telegram_id)
        await update_player(player)
        return player
    
    return None
```

#### User Flow:
1. **User joins main chat** → System detects no existing record
2. **System prompts**: "Welcome! To link to your player record, please provide your phone number:"
3. **User provides phone**: "+447961103217"
4. **System links**: Updates existing record with `telegram_id` and `username`
5. **Success**: Single linked record

### **Strategy 2: Enhanced `/addplayer` Command**

Modify `/addplayer` to include Telegram information when available.

#### Command Format:
```bash
# Option A: Include telegram_id and username
/addplayer Mahmudul Hoque +447961103217 Defender 123456789 @mahmudul_hoque

# Option B: Use phone number as linking key
/addplayer Mahmudul Hoque +447961103217 Defender
```

#### Implementation:
```python
async def register_player(self, name: str, phone: str, position: str, team_id: str, 
                         telegram_id: str = None, username: str = None) -> Player:
    """Register a new player with optional Telegram info."""
    
    # Generate player ID
    player_id = generate_player_id_from_name(name, team_id, existing_ids)
    
    # Generate user_id from telegram_id if available
    user_id = generate_user_id(telegram_id) if telegram_id else f"user_{team_id}_{phone}"
    
    player = Player(
        user_id=user_id,
        player_id=player_id,
        team_id=team_id,
        full_name=name,
        phone_number=phone,
        position=position,
        telegram_id=telegram_id,  # ✅ Include if available
        username=username,        # ✅ Include if available
        status="pending",
        created_at=datetime.utcnow(),
        updated_at=datetime.utcnow()
    )
    
    return await self.player_repository.create_player(player)
```

### **Strategy 3: Automatic Phone Number Detection**

Use Telegram's phone number sharing feature to automatically link users.

#### Implementation:
```python
async def handle_phone_number_share(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Handle when user shares their phone number."""
    
    user_id = update.effective_user.id
    phone_number = update.message.contact.phone_number
    
    # Try to link to existing player record
    player = await link_player_by_phone(phone_number, str(user_id), 
                                      update.effective_user.username, team_id)
    
    if player:
        await context.bot.send_message(
            chat_id=update.effective_chat.id,
            text=f"✅ Successfully linked to your player record: {player.full_name}"
        )
    else:
        await context.bot.send_message(
            chat_id=update.effective_chat.id,
            text="❌ No player record found with that phone number. Please contact team leadership."
        )
```

## Recommended Implementation

### **Phase 1: Phone Number Linking (Immediate)**
1. Implement phone number linking when users join
2. Add phone number prompt in chat flow
3. Update existing records with Telegram info

### **Phase 2: Enhanced `/addplayer` (Future)**
1. Modify `/addplayer` to accept Telegram info when available
2. Add validation for phone number format
3. Implement automatic linking for known users

### **Phase 3: Automatic Detection (Future)**
1. Add phone number sharing button
2. Implement automatic linking via Telegram's contact sharing
3. Add fallback to manual phone number entry

## Implementation Plan

### **Step 1: Add Phone Number Linking Service**
```python
class PlayerLinkingService:
    async def link_telegram_user(self, telegram_id: str, username: str, team_id: str) -> Player | None:
        """Link Telegram user to existing player record."""
        
    async def link_by_phone(self, phone: str, telegram_id: str, username: str, team_id: str) -> Player | None:
        """Link player record by phone number."""
        
    async def prompt_for_phone(self, telegram_id: str, username: str, team_id: str) -> str:
        """Prompt user for phone number to link their account."""
```

### **Step 2: Update Chat Role Assignment Service**
```python
async def _ensure_player_role(self, team_id: str, user_id: str, username: str = None) -> None:
    """Ensure user has a player record if they're in the main chat."""
    
    # Check if player already exists with telegram_id
    existing_player = await self.player_service.get_player_by_telegram_id(user_id, team_id)
    if existing_player:
        return  # Already linked
    
    # Try to link by phone number (if user provided it)
    # If no phone number, prompt user to provide it
    
    # Create new player record only if no linking possible
    if not linked_player:
        await self._create_basic_player_record(team_id, user_id, username)
```

### **Step 3: Add Phone Number Prompt Flow**
```python
async def handle_phone_prompt(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Handle phone number prompt response."""
    
    phone_number = update.message.text
    user_id = update.effective_user.id
    username = update.effective_user.username
    
    # Validate phone number format
    if not is_valid_phone_number(phone_number):
        await context.bot.send_message(
            chat_id=update.effective_chat.id,
            text="❌ Invalid phone number format. Please use international format (e.g., +447123456789)"
        )
        return
    
    # Try to link
    player = await link_player_by_phone(phone_number, str(user_id), username, team_id)
    
    if player:
        await context.bot.send_message(
            chat_id=update.effective_chat.id,
            text=f"✅ Successfully linked to your player record: {player.full_name}"
        )
    else:
        await context.bot.send_message(
            chat_id=update.effective_chat.id,
            text="❌ No player record found with that phone number. Please contact team leadership."
        )
```

## Enhanced Solution: Secure Invite Link System

### **Overview**
The system now implements a **secure invite link system** that embeds player information directly in the invite link, providing automatic linking when users join via their specific invite link.

### **How It Works**

#### **1. Secure Link Creation**
When `/addplayer` is executed:
1. **Player Record Created**: With proper player ID (e.g., `MH1`)
2. **Secure Data Generated**: Player info embedded and signed with HMAC-SHA256
3. **Invite Link Created**: Telegram link with embedded secure data
4. **Firestore Record**: Stores both Telegram link and secure data

#### **2. Automatic Linking**
When user joins via invite link:
1. **Link Validation**: System validates HMAC signature
2. **Player Info Extraction**: Decodes embedded player data
3. **Record Lookup**: Finds player by `player_id`
4. **Automatic Update**: Sets `telegram_id` and `username`
5. **Link Marked Used**: Prevents reuse

#### **3. Fallback to Phone Number**
If secure link validation fails:
1. **Phone Prompt**: Ask user for phone number
2. **Manual Linking**: Use phone number to find player record
3. **Confirmation**: Verify with user before linking

### **Security Benefits**
- **Player-Specific**: Each link is tied to a specific player
- **Tamper-Proof**: HMAC signatures prevent data modification
- **One-Time Use**: Links can only be used once
- **Automatic Expiration**: Links expire after 7 days
- **Audit Trail**: All usage is logged and tracked

### **Implementation Status**
- ✅ **Secure Data Generation**: HMAC-SHA256 signing implemented
- ✅ **Invite Link Service**: Updated with secure data embedding
- ✅ **Player Tools**: Modified to pass player_id to invite service
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive security documentation created

## Conclusion

The **Enhanced Secure Invite Link System** provides:
- **Maximum Security**: Player-specific, tamper-proof links
- **Automatic Linking**: No manual intervention required
- **Fallback Support**: Phone number linking as backup
- **Audit Trail**: Complete usage tracking and monitoring
- **User Experience**: Seamless onboarding process

This system ensures that only the intended player can use each invite link while maintaining a smooth user experience.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate records

This approach ensures that players added via `/addplayer` can be properly linked when they join the main chat, maintaining a single source of truth for player data.

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Implementation**
