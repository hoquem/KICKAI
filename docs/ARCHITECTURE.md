# KICKAI Architecture Documentation

## Overview

KICKAI follows a **feature-first, layered architecture** inspired by Clean Architecture principles, with a **Factory Pattern** for service creation and dependency injection. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Feature-First Modular Structure
- Each feature is self-contained with its own domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Features can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Clear boundaries prevent tight coupling between features

### 2. Layered Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Presentation Layer        │  ← Telegram Bot, Web UI
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Application Layer          │  ← Use Cases, Commands, Handlers
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Domain Layer             │  ← Business Logic, Entities, Services
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Infrastructure Layer         │  ← Database, External APIs
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Factory Pattern for Service Creation
- **ServiceFactory**: Centralized factory for creating all feature services
- **Lazy Creation**: Services are created only when needed
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper dependency management through the factory
- **Cross-Feature Dependencies**: Handled through the factory pattern

## Dependency Management

### Factory Pattern Implementation

```python
# ServiceFactory creates services with proper dependencies
class ServiceFactory:
    def __init__(self, container: DependencyContainer):
        self.container = container
    
    def create_player_registration_services(self):
        # Creates repositories, services, and registers them
        player_repo = FirebasePlayerRepository(self.get_database())
        registration_service = PlayerRegistrationService(player_repo, player_id_service)
        # Register with container
        return {'player_repository': player_repo, 'registration_service': registration_service}
```

### Dependency Container

```python
# Centralized dependency management
class DependencyContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._services = {}
        self._factory = None
    
    def initialize(self):
        # Initialize database
        self._initialize_database()
        # Create factory
        self._factory = create_service_factory(self)
        # Create all services through factory
        self._factory.create_all_services()
```

## Feature Structure

Each feature follows this structure:

```
features/
├── feature_name/
│   ├── application/
│   │   ├── commands/          # Command handlers
│   │   └── handlers/          # Business logic handlers
│   ├── domain/
│   │   ├── entities/          # Business entities
│   │   ├── repositories/      # Repository interfaces
│   │   ├── services/          # Business services
│   │   └── interfaces/        # Service interfaces
│   ├── infrastructure/
│   │   └── firebase_*_repository.py  # Concrete implementations
│   └── tests/
│       ├── unit/
│       ├── integration/
│       └── e2e/
```

## Cross-Feature Communication

### 1. Service-to-Service Communication
- Services communicate through interfaces
- Factory pattern ensures proper dependency injection
- No direct imports between feature implementations

### 2. Event-Driven Communication
- Domain events for loose coupling
- Event handlers in application layer
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate

### 3. Shared Domain Models
- Common entities in `features/shared/`
- Adapters for cross-feature data transformation
- Consistent data models across features

## Database Architecture

### Firebase/Firestore Structure
```
teams/{team_id}/
├── players/
├── matches/
├── payments/
├── attendance/
└── settings/
```

### Repository Pattern
- Interface defined in domain layer
- Implementation in infrastructure layer
- Factory creates concrete implementations

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual services and components
- Mock dependencies using interfaces
- Fast execution, high coverage

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test service interactions
- Use in-memory database for speed
- Verify business logic flows

### 3. E2E Tests
- Test complete user journeys
- Use real Firebase Testing environment
- Validate cross-feature flows

## Security & Access Control

### 1. Team-Based Isolation
- All data scoped to team_id
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Secure data boundaries

### 2. Role-Based Access
- Player vs Admin roles
- Feature-specific permissions
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Async/Await Pattern
- I/O operations are asynchronous
- Non-blocking service calls
- Efficient resource utilization

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Redis for session data
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Cache invalidation on data changes

### 3. Database Optimization
- Indexed queries on team_id
- Efficient data structures
- Connection pooling

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Multi-Environment Support
- Local development with .env
- Testing with .env.test
- Production with Railway environment variables

### 2. Multi-Bot Support
- One bot per team
- Isolated bot sessions
- Centralized bot management

## Monitoring & Observability

### 1. Health Monitoring
- Service health checks
- Database connectivity monitoring
- Bot status monitoring

### 2. Logging Strategy
- Structured logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Feature Migrations
- Gradual migration to new architecture
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

### 2. Data Migrations
- Schema evolution support
- Data transformation utilities
- Rollback capabilities

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Organization
- Follow feature-first structure
- Use factory pattern for service creation
- Maintain clean dependency hierarchy

### 2. Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. Documentation
- Keep architecture docs updated
- Document cross-feature flows
- Maintain API documentation

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing capabilities
- Database sharding strategies

### 2. Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for new features
- API versioning strategy
- Backward compatibility

### 3. Performance
- Caching strategies
- Database optimization
- Async processing improvements
